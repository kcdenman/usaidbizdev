43,Afghanistan,Irdees Rahem,Promote Scholarship Endowment,"The Promote Scholarship Endowment (PSE) provides an endowment to fund higher education scholarships for qualified Afghan women in perpetuity. The endowment enhances women’s empowerment and gender equity, an Intermediate Result in the current strategic framework, by assisting Afghan women in obtaining a university or graduate education, better enabling them to serve in positions of influence in the public and private sectors. The endowment merges with other Promote components to create a full suite of empowerment activities, supporting women from the beginning of their higher education through attaining a professional position. Establishing a permanent endowment also preserves empowerment successes by sustaining long-term educational assistance.

It is precisely because of these development successes that the U.S. government identified a gap in women’s programming - the newfound ability of women to access education and participate in society has resulted in thousands of young women graduating with limited post-graduate opportunities from high schools and universities every year. However, international support is essential to assisting women of all educational attainment levels in overcoming barriers to gaining employment, raising their incomes and achieving leadership roles in their families, communities and the government. To overcome instability and terrorism, Afghanistan requires a balance of voices and perspectives in its national dialog.
Women’s education is an essential development investment to secure a more peaceful, prosperous and resilient country, and women’s empowerment is a critical component in the war against terrorism. An endowment to provide university scholarships for Afghan women will insulate the endowed organization from unpredictable government and donor agency budget fluctuations, allowing an awardee to continue this critical and foundational component of support in a turbulent and insecure environment. Therefore, USAID is investing foreign assistance resources in the PSE to ensure funding stability in the long term.",Gender Equality and Women's Empowerment,,$50M - $99.99M,,Cooperative Agreement,,2018.0,10/31/2018,4/30/2018,5 years,,New Opportunity Not Previously Forecasted,Overseas,2/27/2018,50000000.0,99990000.0,2018-10-31,2018-04-30,2018-02-27

On July 11, 2016 South Sudanese troops, fresh from winning a battle in the capital, Juba, over opposition forces, went on a nearly four-hour rampage through a residential compound popular with foreigners, in one of the worst targeted attacks on aid workers in South Sudan’s three-year civil war. The South Sudanese troops fatally shot a local journalist while forcing the foreigners to watch, raped several foreign women, singled out Americans, beat and robbed people and carried out mock executions. Since July 10, 2016, a Department of State cable approved an ordered departure (OD) from Juba of employees not considered to occupy positions that are essential in an emergency situation (nonemergency employees). As per Department of State Standardized Regulations (DSSR) 636, “[n]ot later than 180 days after the evacuation order is issued, an employee must be returned to the regular post of assignment, or appropriate action must be taken to reassign the employee to another post.” Thus, the Mission anticipates the return of some nonemergency employees as well as implementing partner American citizen (AMCIT) and third country national (TCN) staff under Chief of Mission (COM) authority on or about January 06, 2017.

An important responsibility of the U.S. Embassy during an ongoing threat or attack is to share information with U.S. citizens and assist individuals and organizations implementing U.S. Government programs. In providing assistance to private U.S. citizens during a crisis, the Embassy coordinates with host nation government to respond to emergency situations and protect U.S. citizens. In some high-risk locations, USAID has established PLSOs, which provide continuous information and related security support to USAID’s implementing partners in those countries, and develop and deliver security training courses. Further, the Department of State and USAID have developed policies and standards to comply with Section 846 of the National Defense Authorization Act of Fiscal Year 2013 (P.L. 112-239) and incorporates FAR clause 52.225-19 into contracts operating in countries where it is applicable.",Working in Crises and Conflict,,$1M - $3.99M,WS Insight,Contract,,2019.0,1/31/2019,11/30/2018,1 year,,Combination of Changes,Overseas,3/01/2018,1000000.0,3900000.0,2019-01-31,2018-11-30,2018-03-01
